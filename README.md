# Meme Generator Using React
I created a meme generator project using React. This project will use an API to get the top 100 memes' pictures at that time.
<br/>
<br/>
## How it works?
> Clicking the button will generate a new random image, <br/> 
> typing in the left text box will type text on the upper side of the image, <br/> 
 > and typing in the right text box will give text at bottom side of a meme.<br/> 

## Following concepts of React are used in this project.

1)   Functional components

2)   React states

3)   React Effects/ Side effects

4)   Conditional Rendering 

5)   Getting Data from API

6)   React Form

7)   React Props
